There are advantages and disadvantages to every type of
inspection method.When it comes to tight-tolerance,high-
speed,continuous production of round,opaque and translucent
product,laser line triangulation is the superior inspection
method.Other inspection methods simply cannot perform at
the required level due to the variety of challenges they face
when attempting in-process 100% surface inspection.
In order to obtain accurate OD and ovality measurements,
and in order to detect flaws at any orientation on the product,
the inspection method must examine the entire 360° contour
of the product.When this is achieved,orientation of the part
in the field will have little to no effect on measurement or
flaw detection.
Measurement Methods
OD and ovality are typical measurements made during
continuous production of round product. During startup of
a production line, operators attempt to tune equipment pa-
rameters to obtain the correct OD and ovality.Once the line
is stable and the product is within specifications,the goal is
to continuously run until the desired length has been created.
Periodic checking of OD and ovality is required to ensure the
process is running smoothly.Tighter tolerances necessarily
require better measurement accuracy.Also important is the
method being used to measure OD and ovality,as different
methods present different levels of accuracy and repeatability.
The most common method used to measure OD and oval-
ity gives the Minimum Circumscribed Circle (MCC) and
Minimum Circumscribed Ellipse (MCE) of theproduct.The
MCC is the smallest circle that contains the entire profile of
the measurement target within it.Hand micrometers,laser
micrometers,and camera inspection systems can only measure
MCC and MCE.MCC/MCE is affected by the presence of
small outliers that couldI drastically affect the measured OD
and ovality.All three of these inspection methods also suffer
from inaccuracics based on the orientation and shape of the
part,relative to the measurement device.Laser line triangula-
tion can also measure MCC and MCE,but is unaffected by
orientation of the product in the field.This makes laser line
triangulation the most accurate and repeatable method to
measure MCC and MCE.
Maximum Inscribed Circle(MIC)and Maximum Inscribed
Ellipse (MIE) are other types of OD/ovality measurements.
MIC is the circlethat is contained inside the outer surface of
the measurement target.An MIC measurement is not equiva-
lent to the inner diameter of a tube.This measurement type
is notoften used,as it requires secing 360° around an object,
including any pits or slits that may be present.However,laser
line triangulation is capable of measuring the MIC and MIE
at any orientation.
The Best Fit Circle(BFC)and Best Fit Ellipse (BFE)are
the most stable forms of OD/ovality measurements.Ideally,
best fit measurements will have an equal amount of the con-
tour of the product above and below the best fit measurement.
Best fit measurement methods are significantly more robust to
outlicr points that could drastically change the measurement.If
a small outlier is observed(e.g.,a braid break on the product),
the BFC or BFE may show a small increase in OD,but this
will more accurately reflect the true OD of the part.This is in
opposition to the MCC or MCE,which might show a massive
change in the measurement over the braid break.These more-
stable best fit measurements,robust to outliers,also improve
flaw detection capabilities.The BFC and BFE are the most
stable and accurate forms of OD and ovality measurement.
The MCC/MCE,MIC/MIE and BFC/BFE methods are
illustrated in Figure 1 below.
Fig.1-Product profile (top left), BFC (top right),
MIC(bottom left), MCC (bottom right).
All three measurement types(MCC/MCE,MIC/MIE,and
BFC/BFE)could be used together to get a detailed understand-
ing of a product's true dimensions.Laser line triangulation
is the only technology on the market that can simultaneously
measure your product using all three measurement types,
regardless of the orientation of the part in the field.
Inspection Methods
Ofline Hand Micrometer and Pi Tape.Before noncontact
measurement systems hit the market,offline measurements
were periodically made with mechanical/hand micrometers or
pi tape to check whether the production process was stable and
yielding product of the correct size.This process is destructive,
involving an operator periodically cutting a sample of product
from the line,measuring it with hand micrometers or api tape,
and then adjusting production parameters accordingly until
the product specs are satisfied.From there,the operator may
periodically check the diameter by cutting more pieces out
of the product throughout production,or checking the OD at
the end of a spool.
There are many issues with offline hand micrometer and pi
tape diameter checks.They can be disruptive tests,potentially
requiring that the product be cut then measured,the line ad-
justed accordingly,and then the whole process repeated until
the line is running smoothly.The section being measured may
not be representative of the entire product either.Variation in
OD or ovality over length may be missed,since only a small
section of product is measured offline.Hand micrometers
and pi tapes are also contact measurement devices,which
could result in product being deformed while being measured,
potentially reducing the accuracy of the measurement.Hand
micrometers also require an operator to make multiple meas-
urements around the part to get a sense of ovality, which is
time-consuming and prone to variability operator-to-operator.
Ofline Optical.Offline optical systems have been used
to replace hand micrometers for measuring product during
startup.A similar process to hand micrometer measurements
takes place when using offline optical systems including
tuning the production settings,cutting product out,measur-
ing the cut section,etc.Offline optical systems require that a
very short piece of product be cut,so the part can be placed
on a glass surface for a camera to view.The product is then
compared to the ideal shape and size of that product(typically
an engineering drawing) for comparison.Preparing product
for measurement is again destructive and time-consuming.
Offine optical measurement systems do have the advantage
of being a 360° measurement,meaning orientation is not
critical when measuring the part.However,offline optical is
still a slow mneasurement process and could occur on product
that does not represent what the product will look like for
the rest of the run.Generally,it is very difficult to achieve a
clean cut that is free of burrs,nicks or other deformation.A
less-than-perfect cut causes measurement error.Offline optical
measurements are a great improvement over hand microm-
eter measurements,but still have been superseded by inline
measurement systems that can measure 100% of the product
in-process with no operator interaction required.
Laser Micrometers.Laser micrometers are noncontact
measurement devices that may be placed in a production
line to continuously measure product as it is made.A laser
is projected over the product to create a shadow the size of
the part(see Figure 2).For multi-axis laser micrometers,a
shadow is generated per-axis,to produce an OD measurement
for each axis(see Figure 3).
Laser micrometers are highly repeatable measurement
systems,typically with less than 0.0001"(2.5μm)single-scan
measurement variation on static product 1"(25.4 mm)in outer
diameter.However,laser micrometers are not the most ideal
solution when surface inspection and measurement accuracy
are critical.Laser micrometers are shadow-based systems,
and thius they have dead zones, or blind spots,where product
is not measured or inspected.Additionally, this means that
orientation of the product in the measurement field could
make the difference between detecting and missing a flaw.
Changing oricntation of the part in the field can cause
measurement variation,potentially greater than the accuracy
required to verify theproduct is within specification.The
more the product contour deviates from a perfect circle,the
more error there will be in the OD and ovality measurements.
Take the following examples,depicted in Figure 4 and
Figure 7 below,with the resulting measurements illustrated
in Figure 5,Figure 6, Figure 8 and Figure 9 below as well
as Table 1,Table 2,Table 3 and Table 4 below.

ratio of 2:1 (ovality=1"(25.4mm)).
Measuring the OD of this ellipse is typically calculated
as the average of all the axes of measurement.For a 3-axis
laser micrometer with measuring axes A, B and C,this
would be:
OD=average(A,B,C) (1)
Ovality is often calculated as maximum minus minimum
of all axes of measurement or:
Ovality-maximum(A,B,C)-minimum(A,B,C) (2)
Simulating the 2:I ellipse show in Figure 4 above rotating
180° in a 3-axis and 4-axis micrometer using the above equa-
tions yields the figures listedI below.The OD measurement

above through simulated 3-axis and 4-axis micrometers yields
the following results:
To conclude,laser micrometers yield large variations in
OD and ovality depending on the orientation of the part in
the field during measurement.For inline inspection,this is an
unacceptable inconsistency that most users are unaware of.
Ovality measurement results could be inaccurate as much as
+0.0316"(0.8 mm) when ovality is 0.010"(0.254 mm)and
the surface is stranded.A typical specification for an ovality
measurement on a 1" (25.4 mm) product is around 0.010"
(0.254 mm),meaning the required ovality accuracy must be
better than 0.001"(0.025 mm),which is 10x smaller than the
specification.With a laser micrometer solution,the system
may measure the ovality as 0.0416"(1.06mm),when in reality
the true ovality is 0.010"(0.254 mm).This incorrect measure-
ment occurs due to the shape of the product and orientation
of the product in the field.
These issues translate to laser micrometer flaw detection as
well.Since flaw detection using laser micrometers typically
observes the change in OD and ovality measurements over
a length,false positives will be detected as flaws solely due
to the inaccurate nature of laser micrometer measurements
on nonperfect circular shapes,and the product's orientation
in the field.
Laser micrometers are best used for applications with
less-critical tolerances,or in cases where the larger expense
for a better flaw detection system cannot be justified.Laser
micrometer systems are around 5x less expensive than laser
line triangulation systems,but can be 50x less capable when
detecting lump and bump type surface flaws,and infinitely
worse at detecting pits and slits.
Eddy Current. Eddy current inspection is mainly used
to identify cracks inside the walls of metal pipes.Because
they monitor for changes in a material's conductivity due
to internal defects,eddy current testers are unable to detect
continuous defects,nor any superficial surface defects such as
minor external cracking,scratching or pitting.This also means
that eddy current defect detection does not work on plastics,
wraps,or any other nonconductive materials.Even on metal
products,deeper surface defects are often missed due to the
low detection resolution of eddy current devices.Inspection
speed is also fairly slow for these devices,requiring slower
line speeds for detecting smaller flaws.Eddy current inspec-
tion is typically visualized as a waveform on a graph with
spikes in the graph indicating a flaw is present. This limited
feedback can make it hard to verify the presence of a flaw.
Eddy current devices are for defect detection only;they do
not measure OD or ovality.Therefore,other devices or checks
are typically needed to supplement eddy current testing to
ensure quality product is supplied to the end user.
Spark Testing. Spark testers are used to detect breaks or
thin spots in the jacket of a wire.Products being inspected
by spark testers must be electrically conductive on the inside
and electrically insulated on the outside,meaning that spark
testers are mostly used in specific wire and cable applications.
Spark testers rely on metal chains hanging around a prod-
uct,touching the surface.A high-voltage electrical cloud is
generated around the product.When a thin or missing sec-
tion of an insulating jacket is run through the device,a spark
will be generated,indicating a flaw is present.Product must
be cured or set before entering the spark testers to prevent
permanent deformation due to the necessary contact with the
chains.Spark testers will miss lump and bump-style flaws and
do a poor job of detecting indentations if the insulation is still
thick enough to prevent a spark.Gels,lumps and scratches
in the jacket extrusion are all undetectable with spark testers.
Spark testers are for defect detection only.They do not
perform OD or ovality measurements.Therefore,additional
inspection equipment is typically needed to supplement spark
testers.
Camera Inspection.Camera inspection has gained
popularity in recent years as image analysis capabilities have
advanced and prices have dropped.Multiple cameras can be
used together to surround an object and achieve a 360° view
of the product,potentially allowing for 100% inspection.
However,when it comes to flaw identification,measure-
ment accuracy,and system reliability,camera systems have
significant limitations.
In terms of measurement accuracy,camera systems rank
behind laser micrometers.Camera inspection systems meas-
ure OD by detecting the edges of the product in the camera
image and measuring the distance between the edges.Mul-
tiple cameras at different orientations allow for ovality to be
measured.These measurements are similar to micrometers
in that they measure from one edge of the part to the other.
Camera systems also have lower measurement resolution,
making the measurements less repeatable than those made
by laser micrometers.
Regarding flaw detection,one critical limitation in a cam-
era inspection system is its inability to distinguish between
flaws and changing surface colors due to labels or text on the
product.Classification and recognition are required in order
to distinguish between a flaw versus text when analyzing a
camera image.Thisis an extremely challenging task,often
performed by artificial intelligence algorithms,which have
not yet been vetted or widely distributed.Often times,cam-
era systems are placed inline before labels or text are added
in order to avoid this problem.However this means that the
final product is left uninspected,which could result in flaws
making their way to a consumer.
Camera systems are notorious for being difficult to set
up and maintain as they are very susceptible to changes in
ambient lighting as well as image blur due to the relatively
long time required for cameras to capture an image of the
product.Furthermore,they must include image classification,
or place the inspection unit in a location to avoid text and
labels triggering false positives.It is due to these significant
limitations that many production environments find camera
systems cannot mect their needs.
Operator Inspection (Tactile and Visual).A common
theme in continuous production environments is to have op-
erators check for defects with their hands and/or eyes.This is
either used to verify that a laser micrometer or vision system
did not trigger a false positive, or as the main source of de-
fect detection due to the inadequacies of the aforementioned
inspection methods.
There are clearly some major downsides to checking prod-
uct by hand.If the check is being done during a secondary
process(after production) such as rewind,it can be extremely
time-consuming and costly to perform the inspection.If the
inspection is done inline by running product through an op-
erator's hands,it can be extremely dangerous especially if
the product contains metal braids that could protrude through
the jacket.Hand detection is also extremely subjective and
tedious.Wearing protection like gloves could prevent injury,
however it also dulls the operator's senses and could prevent
him or her from detecting flaws.In terms of visual inspection,
an operator's ability to see small defects will diminish over
time as eye strain and fatigue increases.Inevitably,flawed
product will slip through and make its way to the customer.
Laser Line Triangulation.Laser line triangulation works
by projecting a plane of laser light onto the cross section of a
measurement target.Aportion of the laser light is reflected off
the target and focused onto a sensor (see Figure 10 below).
Fig.10-A laser line trian-
gulation device projecting
a red laser onto product.
The gauge triangulates the depth of the target to create a
point cloud representing the profile or surface of the target
being measured (seeFigure 11 below).
Fig.11-A point cloud generated from a laser line
triangulation device measuring a round product.

Laser line triangulation has been used for decades for ob-
ject detection,partpicking,and basic 3D measurements.With
multiple triangulation gauges arranged in a ring,itis possible
to measure 360°around an object in the field of view.Stitch-
ing successive profiles together enables 3D inspection and
visualization of the product.Recent improvements in laser line
triangulation technology have allowed for processing of many
thousands of points at speeds in excess of 10,000 Hz,enabling
detection of flaws as small as 5μm on moving product.
Triangulation technology enables true 360° defect detec-
tion and measurement,regardless of the product's orientation
in the measurement field.There are no dead zones with laser
line triangulation.This means that regardless of the shape and
orientation of the product in the field,the measurement will
remain the same(sec Figure 12 below).
Fig.12-An elliptical profile with an overlayed best
fit ellipse(BFE)measurement.
Due to its use of high-intensity laser light,laser line tri-
angulation has significantly less motion blur as compared to
camera systems.This is due to the fact that less time is required
for triangulation systems to see their measurement target,as
compared to the time required for camera systems to see LEDs
or other lower-intensity light sources.This ultimately results
in a quicker snapshot of product for laser line triangulation,
allowing for smaller flaws to be detected.This also makes laser
line triangulation less susceptible to changes in ambient light-
ing conditions when compared to camera inspection systems.
Since laser line triangulation uses a brighter light source than
LED-based camera inspection systems,lower exposure times
can be achieved,reducing the risk of detecting ambient light
and disrupting detection capabilities.
It is often most desirable to inspect a product after its final
stage of production, including after text or labels are applied.
Laser line triangulation measures the contour/outline/profile
of the product and inspects for physical surface variation as-
sociated with flaws.Color changes go unnoticed.This is an
advantage that allows for laser line triangulation to perform
inspection on finished product,after labels and text have been
applied,without triggering false positives due to the pres-
ence of text or labels.Albeit,this also means that laser line
triangulation cannot be used to identify colors,text or errors
in text as it's simply ignored by the system.
When a flaw is detected, a 3D image of the flaw can be
presented in real time for serutiny by the user(see Figure 13
and Figure 14 below).
Fig.13-3D visual (left) of a slit flaw (right).
Fig.14-3D visual (left) of a wire loop flaw (right).
Laser line triangulation makes it possible to remove op-
crator hands and eyes from the product,without worry that
defects are slipping through.
Conclusion
Laser line triangulation1 is capable of providing defect
detection at rates of up to 10,000 Hz,allowing for the detec-
tion of flaws as small as 5 μm.In time,inspection rates will
only go up as technology continues to advance.A laser line
triangulation defect detection system can be placed at the
very end of a production line, even after labels and text are
on the product.
When quality is critical,laser line triangulation provides a
robust solution. If line operators are known to turn off alarm
systems because inspection systems produce too many false
positives,laser line triangulation will bring trust and reliability
back into the inspection process.
When laser micrometers are inadequate to detect defects,
laser line triangulation will fill in the dead zones to detect pits,
slits, and flaws up to 50x smaller.
If camera systems prove too inaccurate for OD and ovality
measurements,laser line triangulation will perform at any
product orientation.When camera defect detection struggles
with false positives or defects being detected due to challeng-
ing ambient conditions,laser line triangulation will prove to be
more reliable with its faster sampling rates and insensitivity to
ambient lighting changes.When operators spend time manu-
ally checking product,inline or offline,laser line triangulation
could replace this difficult and subjective job,letting operators
focus on more important tasks.
Laser line triangulation can be utilized to detect defects
and accurately measure OD and ovality,all in one system.
The detected flaws can be reviewed in three dimensions for
operator verification.
Laser line triangulation is the most capable defect detec-
tion and measurement technology that is available on the
market today.
